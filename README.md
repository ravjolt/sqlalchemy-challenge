## SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!




Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.







Step 2 - Climate App
Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.





Temperature Analysis I


Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

Temperature Analysis II


You are looking to take a trip from August first to August seventh of this year, but are worried that the weather will be less than ideal. Using historical data in the dataset find out what the temperature has previously looked like.







Daily Rainfall Average


Now that you have an idea of the temperature lets check to see what the rainfall has been, you don't want a when it rains the whole time!






Daily Temperature Normals


Calculate the daily normals for the duration of your trip. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures. You are provided with a function called daily_normals that will calculate the daily normals for a specific date.
